<h3 id="window" class="no-top-margin">Window</h3>

<p>Encapsulates functionality for a window, used for drawing graphics and handle input events. When creating a window, the graphics (OpenGL context) is also created. Therefor a window must be created before creating any other graphic related objects.</p>

<h4 id="apa">Full screen</h4>

<p>When full screen is set, the width/height used when creating the window will also change the display resolution. If the requested resolution (width/height) is not supported by the display, the closest supported resolution will be used instead. To find out which resolution was selected, use <code>window.width</code> and <code>window.height</code> after creating the window.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var window = new Window({
  // The preferred width for the window (default: 800).
  width: 800,
  // The preferred height for the window (default: 600).
  height: 600,
  // When fullscreen is set the specified width/height is not guaranteed (default: false).
  fullscreen: false,
  // The title for the window (default: 'Play').
  title: 'Example'
});
 
// Gets the width/height of the window. (When using fullscreen these properties represents the current resolution for the display.)
var w = window.width;
var h = window.height;
 
// Graphics object (used for setting render states and drawing primitives).
var graphics = window.graphics;
 
// Change the title for the window.
window.setTitle('Play');
 
// Loop until the user closes the window.
while (!window.isClosing()) {
  // Poll for and process window events.
  window.pollEvents();
}
 
// Close the window.
window.close();
</pre>
