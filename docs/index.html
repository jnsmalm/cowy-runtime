    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Gameplay executes JavaScript using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/" target="blank">Google's V8 JavaScript Engine</a> and an API to draw graphics, handle input and play sounds is built-in. Gameplay does not run inside a web browser, instead it runs as a native application on the current platform. The runtime is a single executable file, easy to distribute so your end users won't have to install anything on their desktop computer for playing your game.</p>
